Using h2o library with Python

# Generalized_Linear_Models-II
The GLM suite includes:

Gaussian regression,Poisson regression,Binomial regression (classification),Quasibinomial regression,Multinomial classification,Gamma regression,Ordinal regression,Negative Binomial regression,Tweedie distribution.

# Environment

Using library h2o in python

# Content of notebook:

Models being applied:

- GLM Binomial
- GLM Multi-nomial
- GLM Poisson aka count 
- GLM Gamma
- GLM Tweedie 

This excercise is a coding practice. Theoratical concepts are discussed very briefly. For detailed theory, I have added .pdf file in repository.

# Modules

numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, h2o
